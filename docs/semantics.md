# Syntax and Semantics

Ludi is designed to be easy for anyone to use, so it tries to be very consistent. Most of the language is comprised of English words, although symbols are used when it is covenant and easy to understand. Below is a comprehensive list of everything in the language which is set to have a consistent meaning:

- *`[` and `]` brackets* Surrounds coordinates. They can appear after a variable to specify what the coordinates are for. Ex: `Board[x,y]`.
- *`(` and `)` parentheses* Surrounds parameters. This can be used when playing an action, or when defining one.
- *`:`* Denotes the beginning of a section.
- *`for`* Specifies which player something applies to.
- *`as`* Assigns some value a name which can be used later.
- *`a`* Says what kind of thing a variable is.
