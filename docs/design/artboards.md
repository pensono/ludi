# Artboards

Artboards are an AI-enabled feature to help you quickly make artwork and sounds for your game. In addition to a library of preset artwork, a paid AI can be used to generate the art. Art is both visuals or text.

## UI

First page is about defining the style. There's a couple preset styles each corresponding to a midjourney/dalle prompt section. Examples: "Cartoon with thick lines", "Hyper realistic fantasy", "Geometric and pastel". For some art styles there's a second option to select a color pallete, also chosen from a preset list.

For individual assets, there's a prompt which is combined with the style to produce the actial art.
